# Introduction

The introduction of the System Requirement Specification (SRS) gives us the complete overview of the scope, summary and technologies to be used. The main purpose of the document is to recognize, examine and complete awareness of Employee Management System (EMS) in detail. It summarizes the targeted audience project, system&#39;s user interface, functional and non-functional requirements and needs.

## Scope

Basically, this SRS is associated with all the features that make Employee Management System live. This project is being developed in order to ensure smooth and effective evaluation of functions provided for the benefits of an organization. From administrative to nonâ€“administrative management in an organization, this project provides a complete set of well-ordered solutions to all the problems. This SRS is not only related to a specific module or tool of this project but it also identifies the entire Employee Management System.

# General Description

  1.
## User Characteristics

The users of the system are:

- Admin
- Employees

The users of the system should know the English language basics and basic knowledge of computer and internet. The separate characteristics of each user are given below:

**Admin:**

Admin should know how to tackle and solve small problems including every error and power failures for the maintenance and smooth running of the system. As the characteristics of admin are concerned, in the aspect of employee, the admin will add a new hired employee and edit/update and delete an existing employee. Admin can calculate the salary of employee i.e calculate loan, dues and allowance etc., manage attendance/leaves and manage work history and promotion of employee.

**Employee:**

The employee can manage its own database and can view salary, pay slip, allowance and attendances/leaves.

## General Constraints

This project focusses on one branch of organization at a time and there is no functionality for other branches of organization to be interlinked.

  1.
## Assumptions &amp; Dependencies

There are many factors that affect the requirements specified in the SRS. These include:

1. Every user of this system should have the good internet speed of 20k or above.
2. To avoid the unauthorized access to this system, the login and passwords will be kept confidential keeping in consideration the security of organization.
3. Ensure the reliability all the time such that any error in the system or system failure does not affect the stored data of the organization.
